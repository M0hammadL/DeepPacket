Code
------
This project was carried as part of my master thesis project and unfurtatenly I have lost access to the original code and since
I am doing my PhD, I did not have time to rewrite the code, However there are some cool people out there who reprdouced  the the resuls of the paper. 
I list these repositories here and will keep updating it till I finally find time and release the official code:


 - **repo1** (`by Wong <https://github.com/munhouiani/Deep-Packet>`_): This repostory replicate the results in the paper and includes proprocessed data and code in PyTorch.
 - **repo2** (`by Ezzeldin Tahoun <https://github.com/PrivPkt/PrivPkt>`_): This repostory has an implemenation of the model in Tensorflow and some scripts for data preprocessing.

 - **repo3** (`by raptor900 <https://github.com/raptor900/DeepPacket`_): This repostory has an implemenation of the model in pytorch but no training script or data set is provided.

 - **repo4** (`by KimythAnly <https://github.com/KimythAnly/deeppacket`_): This repostory has an implemenation of the model in Tensorflow/Keras and some scripts for data
